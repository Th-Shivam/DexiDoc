# DexiDoc

**DexiDoc** is an offline-first document assistant that helps you index, find, and perform basic operations on your local documents using simple, assistant-style commands — with **privacy by default**.

DexiDoc is designed for individuals who want fast, intelligent access to their files **without uploading data to the cloud**.

---

## Why DexiDoc?

Most document tools today assume:

* Your files can be uploaded
* You are always online
* Search is keyword-only
* Automation is risky or opaque

DexiDoc takes a different approach:

* 📴 **Offline-first** – works without internet
* 🔒 **Privacy by default** – your data never leaves your machine
* 💬 **Assistant-style commands** – interact naturally, not via complex UIs
* ⚡ **Fast & lightweight** – optimized for local use

---

## Core Principles

1. **Local-Only by Default**

   * No cloud sync
   * No remote APIs
   * No telemetry unless explicitly enabled

2. **Explainable Actions**

   * Every operation is previewed
   * No silent or destructive changes

3. **Progressive Intelligence**

   * Starts simple and deterministic
   * Smarter features are optional and modular

4. **Minimal, Extensible Core**

   * Small, fast base system
   * Advanced capabilities added via plugins

---

## What DexiDoc Is (Phase 1 Scope)

In its first usable release, DexiDoc aims to:

* Index local documents
* Search them using natural, assistant-like commands
* Perform safe, basic file operations
* Work fully offline

Examples:

```text
find invoices from december
show files modified last week
open my resume
```

---

## What DexiDoc Is NOT (For Now)

To keep the project focused, DexiDoc intentionally does **not** include:

* Cloud storage or sync
* Collaboration or sharing features
* Always-on AI or remote LLMs
* Enterprise compliance tooling
* Automatic background uploads

These may be explored later — but are **explicitly out of scope** for early phases.

---

## Target Users

* Developers and power users
* Privacy-conscious individuals
* Students and researchers
* Anyone with large local document collections

If you care about **control, speed, and privacy**, DexiDoc is for you.

---

## High-Level Roadmap

* **Phase 0:** Problem framing & scope definition (this document)
* **Phase 1:** Offline indexing + CLI search
* **Phase 2:** Assistant-style command interface
* **Phase 3:** Desktop application
* **Phase 4:** Smart document operations
* **Phase 5:** Plugins and power-user features

---

## Privacy Statement (Non‑Negotiable)

* DexiDoc does **not** send your documents anywhere
* All indexing happens locally
* Optional AI features (if enabled) run on-device
* You always control what is indexed and processed

---

## Status

🚧 **Early-stage / planning phase**

This project is currently in active design and prototyping.

---

## Philosophy

> *Your documents are yours. DexiDoc exists to help you work with them — not extract value from them.*

---

## License

DexiDoc is released under the **MIT License**.

This keeps the project:

* Simple and permissive
* Friendly for personal and commercial use
* Easy to fork, extend, and embed

---

## Name Origin

**DexiDoc** = *Dexterous* + *Documents* — a fast, capable assistant for your files.
